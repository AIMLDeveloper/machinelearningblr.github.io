We are rebooting ML Bangalore Meetup. Nothing works better than hands-on experience. So, in this meet-up, I wanted to invite those who would want to be a part of developing this community into an active lab, where we can teach, learn and solve problems. We recently created solutions on superresolution, live 3d reconstruction, real-time embeddings search in millions of images, video compression up-to 300% on top of HEVC, and have worked on some super cool experiments like Zero-Shot Learning, Correlation vs Convolutions, depth from Monocular image, etc.

Let's meet up and let's define how we can shape this group into a platform of choice for experts as well as beginners.
