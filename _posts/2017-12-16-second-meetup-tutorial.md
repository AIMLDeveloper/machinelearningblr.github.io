## How to follow this video?

There are two parts to this 2nd tutorial/video:
1. Linear Classifier - Basics
2. Classification - Approach

We will first cover _Linear Classification_.

Click the button below to start the tutorial part 1. Follow this link _while_ you're following the video. 

**Note:** We are building a process where you will **have** to solve problems to go to the next step. Chapters/Tutorials would be locked unless you solve few problems. Till then we hope you follow these tutorials religiously! Open iPython on your end, and then follow the link below:
